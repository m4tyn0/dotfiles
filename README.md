# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for setting up and maintaining a consistent development environment across multiple machines. It includes configurations for shells, text editors, and other tools to streamline my workflow.

## Overview

The dotfiles include configurations for:

- **Bash**: Customizes the shell experience.
- **Zsh with Oh My Zsh**: Enhances the shell interface with themes and plugins.
- **Vim**: Sets up the Vim editor according to my preferences.
- **Nano**: Provides a simple text editing experience with customized settings.
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Includes settings, keybindings, and snippets for VS Code, along with a script to install my preferred extensions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your home directory (or any preferred location), naming it `.dotfiles` to keep it hidden and organized.

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git ~/.dotfiles
   ```

2. **Run the Install Script**:
   The repository includes an `install.sh` script that automates the setup process. This script installs Oh My Zsh (if not present), creates symbolic links for the dotfiles to their required locations, and sets up the development environment.

   ```bash
   cd ~/.dotfiles
   ./install.sh
   ```

## Contents and Configuration

### Shell Configurations

- `.bashrc`: Bash shell configuration.
- `.zshrc`: Zsh configuration, set up to work with Oh My Zsh for an enhanced shell experience.

### Editor Configurations

- `vimrc`: Vim configuration for an optimized editing experience.
- `nanorc`: Nano configuration for when I need a straightforward editor.

### Visual Studio Code Configuration

- `vscode_settings.json`, `vscode_keybindings.json`, and `vscode_snippets`: Custom settings, keybindings, and snippets for VS Code.
- `vscode_extensions.list`: A list of VS Code extensions to be installed via the install script.

### Installation Script (`install.sh`)

- Installs Oh My Zsh (if not already installed).
- Creates symbolic links from the dotfiles in this repository to their expected locations in the home directory.
- Applies editor configurations for Vim, Nano, and VS Code, including installing VS Code extensions listed in `vscode_extensions.list`.

## Updating Your Configurations

To update your configurations:

1. Make changes to the files within the `.dotfiles` directory.
2. Commit and push these changes to your repository.
3. On any machine, pull the latest changes from the repository and rerun the `install.sh` script if necessary.

This approach ensures that your development environment is easily replicable and consistent across all your machines.

## Contributions

While this is a personal setup, contributions or suggestions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or pull request.
